# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

Please make sure the build succeeds locally before pushing your modifications.

TL;DR:
1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
2. Create a branch for your modifications, branching off from `dev`
3. Make your changes and push
