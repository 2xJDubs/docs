# Utility & Inflation

## Inflation

Currently there is no inflation taking place yet. This will be introduced after the novel staking and governance model
proposal is accepted.

As our previous and current proposition, inflation shall be capped at 10% per year. Note that this can be changed, but
only through the governance mechanisms of the Moonsama Network. The staking rewards (potentially including the collator
rewards) shall come from this inflation. This would mean that about 100,000,000 tokens is the maximum number of tokens
that would come to the market in the first year due to inflation. The exact distribution of these newly minted tokens
(various rewards, yields, or MCF) is to be decided.

## Token utility

SAMA is the native token of Moonsama Network.

On Moonsama Network SAMA is providing the following utility features:

- SAMA is the gas token of the Moonsama- and Exosama Network. Every transaction, including the deployment/operation of
dApps, costs SAMA to ensure the security of the network. In certain cases the cost of transactions are subsidized in the
form of gasless transactions.
- Moonsama Network acts as a platform for issuing new assets, such as in-game assets and NFTs, some of which are to be
paid in SAMA.
- SAMA acts as a governance mechanism and trading currency of the Raresama NFT Marketplace.
- Certain utility-infrastructure and services on top of Moonsama Network require SAMA for access.
- Moonsama might periodically launch SAMA staking-campaigns, requiring to stake SAMA over a certain period of time to
gain access to certain utilities or events. Moreover some games and tournaments require a temporary safety-deposit of
SAMA that can be confiscated in the unfortunate cases of abuse or cheating.
- The provisioning of XCM capable assets will cost SAMA.
- Paraverse auctions (should the proposal to implement such a thing passes) will require prospective communities to bond
SAMA, either self-funded or through means of crowdfunding, to take their place in the larger governance and gain access
to metaverse utilities.
- Collator nodes producing blocks and ensuring the liveliness of the network are required to stake SAMA to enforce
non-malicious behavior.
- Participation in on-chain governance can rely on the holding of and/or bonding of SAMA.
