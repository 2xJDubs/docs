# Utility & Inflation

## Inflation

As our previous and current proposition, inflation shall be capped at 10% per year. Note that this can be changed, but 
only through the governance mechanisms of the Moonsama Network. The staking rewards (potentially including the collator 
rewards) shall come from this inflation. This would mean that about 100,000,000 tokens is the maximum number of tokens 
that would come to the market in the first year due to inflation. The exact distribution of these newly minted tokens 
(various rewards, yields, or  MCF) is to be decided.

## Token utility

SAMA is the native token of Moonsama Network.

On Moonsama Network SAMA is providing the following utility features:

- SAMA is the gas token of the Exosama Network. Every transaction, including the deployment/operation of dApps, costs 
SAMA to ensure the security of the network. In certain cases the cost of transactions are subsidized in the form of 
gasless transactions.
- Moonsama Network acts as a platform for issuing new assets, such as in-game assets and NFTs, some of which are to be 
paid in SAMA.
- SAMA acts as a governance mechanism and trading currency of the Raresama NFT Marketplace.
- Moonsama periodically launches SAMA staking-campaigns, requiring to stake SAMA over a certain period of time to gain 
access to certain utilities or events. Moreover some games and tournaments require a temporary safety-deposit of SAMA 
that can be confiscated in the unfortunate cases of abuse or cheating.

### Upcoming utility

- The provisioning of certain XCM capable assets will cost SAMA.
- Paraverse auctions will require prospective communities to bond SAMA, either self-funded or through means of 
crowdfunding, to take their place in the larger governance and gain access to metaverse utilities.
- Collator nodes producing blocks and ensuring the liveliness of the network are required to stake SAMA to enforce 
non-malicious behavior.
- Participation in on-chain governance requires the holding of and/or bonding of SAMA.
