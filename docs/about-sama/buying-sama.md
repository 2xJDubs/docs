# How can I buy SAMA?

Currently, there are two options for purchasing SAMA tokens. More options will be available in the near future.

1. [MEXC, a centralized exchange](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/SAMA_USDT)
WARNING:SAMA on MEXC is only the ERC20 version and can only be withdrawn to Ethereum.

2. [Uniswap V3, a decentralized exchange](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xe04f47ff45576249bc5083dfdf987e03d0550113)

3. [Khaos exchange](https://khaos.exchange). Note: as we are moving away from Exosama Network and Multichain bridge
   ceased operation, liquidity is scarce here so we are not recommending to use this any more.
