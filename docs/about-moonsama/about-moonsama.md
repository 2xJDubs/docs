# What is Moonsama

<!-- 
    NFTs are a subset of what we offer, maybe we specify "token" infrastructure and utility instead?

Moonsama is the multi-chain protocol enabling rapid building for NFT applications.

Moonsama accelerates the go-to market of NFT-powered solutions by providing a layer of common, critical 
building blocks.

## The Future of NFT Utility

Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are becoming increasingly popular and are being used in a wide 
variety of ways. There are many potential use cases for NFTs, ranging from art and collectibles to gaming and virtual 
real estate. However, despite their potential, many NFT projects struggle to build and deliver on their roadmap due to 
challenges such as scalability and interoperability.

This is where Moonsama comes in. Moonsama provides infrastructure solutions that allow builders to leapfrog over some 
of the most critical building blocks and to focus on what makes their projects unique. By simplifying the process of 
building and deploying NFT projects, Moonsama is helping to drive innovation in the NFT space and empower creators to 
bring their visions to life.
