# Moonsama Network

Moonsama network is a production parachain on Polkadot. That means we have the flexibility to implement
token-based runtime logic and governance while having access to other networks 
([via XCM](/docs/category/xcm-interoperability)) and the shared security model of Polkadot.

For more information about the live network, see 
[Moonsama on Polkadot.js.org](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.moonsama.com%2Fws#/explorer).

Moonsama Network is fully EVM compatible. You can find connection and RPC info
[here](https://chainlist.org/?search=2199) 
and browse EVM transactions in the [EVM explorer of Moonsama Network](https://explorer.moonsama.com).

For more properties of the network, see [About Moonsama Network](/docs/moonsama-network/About) 
and for a deeper dive into the on-chain runtime, [check out the technical documentation](/docs/category/moonsama-network/).
