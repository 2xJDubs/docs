# Governance

Current governance model of Moonsama follows a simple token voting system with Moonsama and Exosama NFTs. This means 1 Moonsama NFT = 1 vote, and 1 Exosama NFT = 0.1 vote to reflect the supply of each collection. The general sentiment of the community is determined by the Moonsama Assembly, participants of the Governance channels on Telegram and Discord. Here proposals can be submitted and voted on by simply submitting "thumbs up" or "thumbs down emojis" on them. This is indicative, a measure of sentiment, providing pre-filtering of potential ratifiable proposals.

If a proposal reaches serious interest, it can be enacted as an official proposal of the Townhall. Townhall is an in-metaverse parlaiment, where active proposals can be voted on on voting terminals, each according to their voting-weight determined by NFT holdings. Proposals passed are then ratified and executed by the DAO President and the Moonsama Core team.

Past proposals can be found [here](https://mcapi.moonsama.com/townhall).

The Moonsama team are working collaboratively with [partners from Jur](https://jur.io/) to introduce a novel governance model 
that reflects the unique aspects of its ecosystem and ensures fair and meaningful participation by its members. At the 
core of this model are principles of decentralization, active engagement, and balanced economic rewards. The model also 
leverages the unique properties of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to encourage a greater sense of community and commitment 
among its members.

### Key Principles and Ideas

**NFT-Based Governance:** The foundation of Moonsama's governance model lies in the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). 
These unique digital assets provide holders with a stronger sense of community and engagement than traditional tokens, 
due to their individualized nature.

**Progressive Decentralization:** The model allows for a gradually decentralized governance structure. Early stages of 
implementation might retain central authority with the core team, with NFT holders informally voting on decisions that 
the team then enacts. Over time, the governance structure evolves to a more democratically oriented body, accommodating 
more NFT collections (referred to as families) within the ecosystem.

**Dual-Level Governance:** Governance is divided into two tiers. Project-related decisions are the domain of token 
holders, while runtime governance, which involves more structural economic benefits and decisions, is decided by NFT 
holders.

**Economic Rewards for Active Participation:** To encourage network participation and avoid regulatory complications, 
economic benefits are tied to active engagement in the governance process. This means that simply owning an NFT does 
not guarantee access to these benefits; one must also actively participate in network decisions.

**Voting Qualification and Weighting:** Voting eligibility and influence are determined based on the concept of 
"Citizen Power," a measure that considers both NFT ownership and engagement. This ensures that the individuals who are 
most active in the network have a significant say in its governance.

**Staking and Unstaking Mechanisms:** Both tokens and NFTs can be staked to gain additional benefits, with specific 
rules and timeframes guiding the staking and unstaking processes. These mechanics encourage long-term commitment and 
active participation in the ecosystem.

**Structured Assemblies for Proposals and Voting:** The idea of structured voting sessions or assemblies is proposed 
to enhance the democratic functioning of the ecosystem. During these sessions, proposals can be made by NFT holders 
and voted upon, ensuring community participation in important decisions.

**Future Developments:** The governance model leaves room for future enhancements, such as cross-governance, dispute 
resolution, and oracle integration, which can be implemented as the community and the technology matures.

**Reinforcing Ecosystem Utility Token Value:** To strengthen the economic structure and ensure the utility token's 
value, the model recommends limiting the sale of NFTs to only be paired with the primary token. This encourages 
consistent alignment of all participants' interests, which helps to increase the network's overall value.


:::note 
However, it is crucial to note that this model is a work in progress, and some of the principles and concepts may be 
modified or refined in the finalized version.
