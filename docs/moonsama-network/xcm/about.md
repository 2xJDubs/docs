# About

Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM) is supported on Moonsama Network and enables Moonsama users to access the functionality
of other Polkadot parachains. Meanwhile, users of other Polkadot parachains can also access the underlying runtime
asset logic of Moonsama Network.

More information about the functionality exposed via XCM and how it can be used will be released soon.
