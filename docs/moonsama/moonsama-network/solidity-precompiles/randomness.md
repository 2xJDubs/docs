# Randomness Precompile

## Introduction

Moonsama Network utilizes verifiable random functions (VRF) to generate randomness that can be verified on-chain. A VRF
is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that
these random values were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure the random values
generated were calculated correctly.

There are two available sources of randomness that provide random inputs based on block producers' VRF keys and past
randomness results: local VRF and BABE epoch randomness. Local VRF is determined directly within Moonsama Network using 
the collator of the block's VRF key and the last block's VRF output. On the other hand, 
[BABE](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe) epoch randomness is based on all
the VRF produced by the relay chain validators during a complete 
[epoch](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#epoch).
