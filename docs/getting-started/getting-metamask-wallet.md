:::note
The secret recovery phrase should be manually noted down and placed into safe location. It is highly recommended **NOT** to save the seed onto a cloud service or take a screenshot of it as this will potentially make it vulnerable for others to view or obtain. Please act carefully to safeguard your phrase for the protection of your assets and funds 🤝
