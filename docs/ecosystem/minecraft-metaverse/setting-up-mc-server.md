# Setting up for Minecraft Servers


# Setup for each Minecraft Server

This lesson outlines the steps for setting up available Moonsama Minecraft Servers.

Now that you are the proud owner of a Moonsama NFT, you have successfully installed Minecraft and you have your Moonsama NFT safely on the bridge, you are ready for your first Moonsama Minecraft session. This lesson explains how you can add the various Moonsama Minecraft servers to your Minecraft installation, when this is completed you can begin!

**Follow these general steps for adding Moonsama server addresses:**

1. Ensure you have a Microsoft account and that you have Minecraft Java version installed properly as explained in lesson 7.
2. The Moonsama Minecraft servers use **release 1.18.2**. This release is automatically available in your MC launcher.
3. Open Minecraft Launcher (it should automatically login with your MineCraft Microsoft account):

6. Now you will see the below screen, it shows all your available servers. Initially this screen will be empty. In the example below several servers have already been added. To explain how you can add servers we will show you how the season server should be added. At the end of this lesson all available Moonsama Minecraft servers have been listed, to add these you should follow the same process as in the following example.

7. Click "Add Server" and:
- Give the server a specific name such as ‚ÄúMoonsama Main‚Äù so the purpose of the server is clear to you.
- Input the appropriate server address, in this example: "mc.moonsama.com". (next section outlines all available servers)
- Set resource packs to "Enabled" - as shown below:

9. To start your session select the server as shown in the screenshot above and click "Join Server", now the session will start and you will begin in the lobby for Moonsama Minecraft.
10. As can be seen in the image from the lobby below you can now select between the following servers to visit:

To ensure that the Moonsama team and committee can communicate with all Moonsama Minecraft players (should a need arise for gameplay or review of fairplay) you are required to link your telegram or discord handle with the Minecraft bridged account. Below you will find the steps to do this, the first 4 steps are equal for either Telegram or Discord:
