# **Introduction to the Moonsama Carnage Event**

Carnage event is the first and most important event on Moonsama's first Multiverse test Metaverse, Minecraft. Every week on Sundays at 16:00 UTC, the whole community comes together for 2 hours to play, have fun and farm or fight for resources, which get exported into the Blockchain (Exosama Network, $SAMA) and used to craft cool NFTs on-chain, like skins, weapons and usefull fun tools, as any other gaming experience with the addition of on-chain and Web3 functionalities. The first Moonsama Carnage event took place on the 31st of October 2021, one of the best Halloweens we will always remember, our Moonsamas earned utility! 

![minecraft-carnage-](img/minecraft-carnage-.png)

The timing of Sunday at 16:00 UTC was chosen because it the most to our community as a whole, was voted for and agreed upon. 

## **What is the purpose of Carnage Event?**

Our goal is to have fun with the community every week and get as much of those important Minecraft resources (also called Multiverse Assets) above mentioned as possible. Remember, only those which are in our inventory will count, those in chests won't. It's required to play minimum 1 Hour for our loot to be considered.

The Carnage event encompasses multiple servers that can each hold 200 players, dedicated for Europe and for North America, but anyone joins smoothly.

We all start out ‚Äúnaked‚Äù with nothing in our inventory besides of our buffs (depending on what are we playing with), 64 soul-bound torches and 4 soul-bound McDonnie‚Äôs Burger Patties. Soul-bound means that we can‚Äôt loose them if we die. If you have off-hands NFT items bridged you can equip them as well.

Each time we die, our loot will be thrown to the ground for 5 minutes and we can respawn at the central spawn point (the central place where everyone starts). However you can also set a personal respawn point by crafting a bed and sleeping in it, for that you just right click on it, not actually needed to sleep.

Some players will go to forests, some will mine, others will try to hunt other players (PvP) to get their loots and every other combination you can think of!

We will lose health and get hungry, however for the first part of the session this will be taken care of by the McDonnie‚Äôs Burger Patties. Just to be sure you do not run out we recommend to find some extra food at the start (from animals, trees, grain‚Ä¶). Additionally, you will need wood to craft all the required tools, so better cut down some trees soon too. Here is what we call ‚ÄúHotbar‚Äù and above it you can see the exp, health and hunger stats.

![minecraft-carnage-](img/minecraft-carnage-1.png)

Then it will be time to upgrade our gear to cobblestone tools. Luckily, that can be found everywhere underground and in mountains!

Once you get everything you need, it‚Äôs your turn to decide which resources you will go for. A quick difficulty comparison between obtaining some of those resources would be: Cobblestone > Wood > Iron > Gold > Moonstones.
Experience Orbs (EXP) are a bit more tricky to compare as you can get them by mining some items like coal, smelting some ores like gold, killing wild animals and monsters, hunting other players...

Some people play alone, some people play in couples and others in big teams. Take this into consideration for your strategy :)

You can find more details about Minecraft rewards here:

[17 - Carnage Rewards and Crafting ](https://www.notion.so/17-Carnage-Rewards-and-Crafting-fa4a822dfd654fc09ef60110af5352db?pvs=21)

## Moonsama Minecraft Resources

As explained above, the purpose of the Carnage event is to finish the game with as many resources as possible in your inventory.

Some time after each Carnage event, each player‚Äôs loot becomes available on the [Moonsama‚Äôs Multiverse Portal](https://multiverse.moonsama.com). The Minecraft resources are then bridged to Moonsama Network‚Äôs Network as ERC-20 / ERC-1155. This is the same Portal that is used to import and export Moonsama NFTs, VIP Tickets, Embassy passes and offhands. 

On the [Moonsama Marketplace](https://marketplace.moonsama.com/collections) the resources collection is called ‚ÄòMultiverse Asset Factory‚Äô, the resources provide utility, are transferable and tradable:

![Screenshot 2022-06-05 at 22.37.50.png](img/Screenshot_2022-06-05_at_22.37.50.png)

- In-game Moonstone Swords are NOT the upcoming Moonsword NFTs
- Ores can be found between Y: -63 to 14
- Ore clusters can consist of 1-12 ores in a vertical arrangement, with gaps between ores
- Most clusters will only consist of a single ore

## Carnage Event Features

Moonsama Carnage has several different characteristics introduced, both "negative" and "positive", for encouraging players to play more clean, honest and also balance the game a bit to some minimum levels, as we know the gap between new players and "pros" can be really huge. These little changes were introduced little by little, definitely worked and made the sessions even more fun!

In general, in the end if you cheat you will get caught, so please don‚Äôt even try!

**Carnage - Top 10**  

- ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Please note: If you are logged as one of the top 10 players in a carnage session for Iron, Gold, String and EXP it is highly possible that you will be notified (via Moonsama telegram and discord channels and direct contact via telegram or discord will also be used where required) the recording of your session to be reviewed by Moonsama Police and Court, so that they may verify the resources have been acquired fairly.
